A variable in C is a named piece of memory which is used to store data and acccess it whenever required.

- It allows us to use the memory with out having to memorize the exact memory address.
- To create a variable in C, we have to specify a name and the type of data it is going to store.
- C provides different **Data types** that can store almost all kinds of data. For example, `int`, `char`, `float`, `double`, etc.
- Every variable must be declared before it is used. We can also declare multiple variables of same data type in a single statement by separating them using comma.
