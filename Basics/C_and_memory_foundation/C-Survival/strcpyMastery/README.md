# Using the `strcpy` in C

In C, `strcpy()` is a built-in function used to copy one string into another. It is a part of the C standard strings library.

- The strcpy function in C is used to copy a string, with syntax: `strcpy(dest, src);`, where dest is the destination array and src is the source string.
- It returns a pointer to the dest string after copying the content from src.
