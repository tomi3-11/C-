# Pointer Arithmetic in C
Pointer Arithmetic is a set of valid arithmetic operation that can be performed on pointers.

> Note: Pointer variables store the memory address of a variable in C. It doesn't store any value.

Hence, there are only a few operations that are allowed to perform on Pointers in C language. These operations are:

1. Increment/Decrement of a Pointer.
2. Addition of integer to a pointer 
3. Subtraction of integer from a pointer 
4. Subtracting two pointers of the same type 
5. Comparison of pointers

> Note: When we use pointers in programs, their addresses keep changing on every run because modern operating systems use ASLR(Address Space Layout Randomization), which randomizes memory locations for security.
