# C Beginner CLI Projects

Welcome to my collection of **beginner-friendly C command-line projects!**  
These small programs are perfect for learning the fundamentals of C programming — including input/output, conditionals, arithmetic, and functions.

## Project 1: Simple Calculator

A simple **CLI calculator** that performs basic arithmetic operations.

### Features
- Accepts two numbers from the user  
- Supports the four main operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`  
- Displays the result of the operation

### Example Output
```text
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Enter operation (+, -, *, /): *
Result: 50
```

###  How to Compile and Run
```bash
# Compile
gcc cal.c -o cal

# Run
./calculator
```

### What I Learned
* Using printf and scanf for input/output

* Performing arithmetic operations

* Handling basic control flow with if statements

## Project 2: Temperature Converter
A temperature conversion tool that converts values between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

### Features
- Converts Celsius → Fahrenheit

- Converts Fahrenheit → Celsius

- User selects the conversion mode

### Example Output
```text
Choose conversion:
1. Celsius to Fahrenheit
2. Fahrenheit to Celsius
Enter choice: 1

Enter temperature in Celsius: 0
0°C = 32°F
```

### How to Compile and Run
```bash
# Compile
gcc converter.c -o converter

# Run
./converter
```
### What I Learned
- Using functions for modular code

- Working with floating-point numbers (double, float)

- Formatting output cleanly
