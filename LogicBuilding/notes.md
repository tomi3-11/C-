# Logic building in C
This is my journey learning to solve problems in c. It 's about creating clear step by step methods to solve problems using simple rules and principles

### Here are some tips for improving programming logic

1. Understand the problem: Read and Understand the problem
2. Generate Examples: Create additional input and output cases for each problem.
3. Draw observations: Draw observations and patterns based on the examples you created
4. Start with basic: First, think of the basic way to solve the problem then optimize the solution.
